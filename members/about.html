        <h1>About the April Society</h1>
        <p>The April Society is a private fellowship devoted to fostering connections, facilitating recreation, and harnessing the power of teamwork to achieve bigger things together than its members can do alone. Our motto is "share the hearth," which is reflective of our desire to come together in community and contribute to something worthwhile for all members while supporting each other as individuals. Though the Society's activities are entirely legal and ethical, much of the enjoyment lies in conducting them discreetly. For this reason, it humbly requests that members and associates do not needlessly discuss its existence or operations with outsiders.</p>
        <p>Membership is offered for united interest in fellowship. All new extensions of true membership are unanimously agreed upon by the full roster of active members to ensure good faith and continued friendship, and must be formally accepted by the initiate in ceremony. Each member can unilaterally extend an offer of association to anyone whom they deem fit, so long as they report their intention to do so at a meeting with quorum in advance. Associates may carry April Society issued identification, but are not members, cannot attend internal meetings or vote, and are inherently exempt from all dues. Associates may be automatically invited to some events otherwise available by direct invite only, and do not need to formally acknowledge their status for registration.</p>
        <p>Participation is exciting, fun, and an excellent way to maintain personal connections in a time when that task can be difficult for many people. If you have been invited, come share the hearth!</p>
